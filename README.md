A Codeup Capstone project created using Java, Springboot, Hibernate, JPA, Thymleaf, Jquery, Mapbox API, FileStack API, and TalkJS API.

Battle Buddies was made to help ease the transition of military families to new duty stations. 
Many military members are living in places they have never been to before and they may not have biological relatives or friends 
living in the area but they do have individuals who are related by the unique bond they share by being associated with the military. 
This application is intended to give military service members and their families an extended family wherever they are stationed,
as well as a safe space and unique community for active duty U.S. military and their spouses (Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard).
To conform to military regulations regarding fraternization (inappropriate relationships), users will have access restricted 
to view only specific members based on the user type and ranking association.

A Battle Buddie's user can:

1. Add and chat with friends.

2.Browse new friends by similiar interests through traits, hobbies, and family life style.

3.Have acess to our unique Suggested Buddies section that ensures that you are matched with the best potential friends.

4.Create and attend meetups in their area.
